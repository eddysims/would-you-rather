<Meta title="components/Logo" component={Logo} />

# Logo

The `Logo` component will render an `svg` of the Logo for the Would You Rather project.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable component={Logo} />

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">{(args) => <Logo {...args} />}</Story>
</Canvas>

## As an icon

You can render the `Logo` as just the icon by setting the `variation="icon"` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="As an icon" args={{ variation: "icon" }}>
    {(args) => <Logo {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
