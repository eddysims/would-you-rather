# Would you rather

Would you rather is a web based "Would you rather" game that uses [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/), [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Hasura](https://hasura.io/).

## Creating a component

Components should be created in isolation. To do so, you should develop your component as much as possible in Storybook. To start storybook run:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

## Starting the project

To start the project run `yarn dev`.
